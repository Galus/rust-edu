Various rust projects and tutorials

# Chip8 Emulator August 2024
The goal is to play tetris and see some funky demos run on a chip8 vm I build.

- Intro to Designing VMs and Emulators.
- Interested in compilers and low level stuff.
- Always wanted to deal with a graphics library.
- Helps to teach me about SDL (simple directmedia layer), WebGL, D3D, Vulkan, OpenGL, pygame and WGPU.

# Tokio Tutorial July 2024
Left off midway thru channels,
channels are my favorite b/c of experience w/ Scala's Akka Actor-Model system b4 it went pay2play.

Maybe watching a YT vid on the Ordering types 'Relaxed', 'Acquired', 'SeqCst', 'AcqRes'
Note to self: dont veer off from the lesson material to skip ahead to advanced topics:
- MutexGuards led to this article: https://cliffle.com/blog/rust-mutexes/
- That article led to Ordering on Atomic types.
- That led to a video explaining it ~1hr.
