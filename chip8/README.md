1. `src/main.rs`: This will be the entry point of your emulator, containing the main loop and initialization code.

2. `src/memory.rs`: To handle memory-related operations and the memory layout you described in the comments at the end of the file.

3. `src/display.rs`: For managing the screen and drawing operations.

4. `src/input.rs`: To handle keypad input.

5. `src/sound.rs`: For managing sound-related functionality.

6. `src/timer.rs`: To handle the delay and sound timers.

By separating these components into different files, you'll improve the organization and maintainability of your project. You can then use Rust's module system to bring these components together in your `main.rs` file.
